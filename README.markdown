###The First Open-Source Book
As the book develops I will commit my progress regularly to GitHub. This means that anyone can edit, contribute to, or fork the book as it's being written, adding both to the quality of the book and helping to foster a new creative writing process. 

If you contribute to the book on GitHub you will be listed as a contributor or editor, whichever is more appropirate, when it is finally published.
