# Design Patterns for Startups

## Use elements of successful startups to increase your project's chances of success. 


###What Are the Elements of A Successful Startup?
That's a question I am obsessed with answering. Successful startups have common elements that can be identified, categorized and applied to any web business.

What are the similarities between Facebook and Google? Between Groupon and Zynga? By identifying the commonalities between these great companies we can begin to find patterns, design patterns, that anyone can use to improve their ability to target and retain users and increase their chances of success.  

###The First Open-Source Book
As the book develops I will commit my progress regularly to GitHub. This means that anyone can edit, contribute to, or fork the book as it's being written, adding both to the quality of the book and helping to foster a new creative writing process. 

If you contribute to the book on GitHub you will be listed as a contributor or editor, whichever is more appropriate, when it is finally published.
